## Description
Following my graduation from Wilmington University, I wanted to assemble a portfolio of work. This webstie was built using React, Tailwind CSS and the component library Aceternity. This was my first project built using Tailwind CSS and I thoroughly enjoyed using it.

## Getting Started

```bash
# install dependencies
npm i

#start application
npm run dev
```
